# Kaggle Hybrid House Prices Prediction

Please leave a star :star: on this repository if it manages to help you in any way. I am welcoming of constructive suggestions. 

The goal was to predict accuracy as possible the sale prices of houses in the city of Ames in the state of Iowa, USA.

This was the second competition I participated in on Kaggle. This one was more difficult than the first due to the fact tha there were many features avaialble to us. So feature engineering became a bit of an issue here. For this purpose, I went through a lot of notebooks available on the kaggle leaderboard for this competition. The features which I included are the ones which I saw were widely accepted than a few others which I decided against including.

# Scope for Improvement:

1. Making new features through combination, plotting and relation mapping these w.r.t. the SalePrice. 
2. Use other types of regression methods than the ones I did. 
3. More outliers may be present in our data frames than we think there are, so if possible please perform necessary visualisations 
4. Blending is just to help increase your score or evaluation on the site. You may not have to do any of the above well.

I've tried to explain the code as much as I could. I recommend going through the documentation pages of the different functions and packages used.
